- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @techbod56
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m retired and now wanting to learn all aspects of arduino raspberry Pi et al
- been an FSE in loads of different equipment all my life 
- I do know the difference between my anode and cathode, just ğŸ™‚
- but Im older and learning something new
- so please be patient if I ask what appears to you a basic question 
- rember the only silly question is the one that you dont ask
- and if you think I sound like yout grand father,
- its because I am possibly older than your grandfather  ğŸ‘´
- ğŸ“« you can reach me here online
